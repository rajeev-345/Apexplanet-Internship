The CIA Triad 

The CIA Triad is a fundamental model for security. Think of it as the three main goals you're trying to achieve to keep information safe.

Confidentiality: This means keeping data secret and accessible only to authorized people. An example is using a strong password to protect your email.

Integrity: This ensures that data is accurate and has not been tampered with or corrupted. For instance, a bank's record of your balance must be correct and unchanged.

Availability: This means that authorized users can access the information and systems whenever they need to. A good example is a website that is always online and doesn't crash.

Threat Types

These are the different kinds of malicious activities or attacks we might face.

Phishing: Tricking someone into revealing sensitive information (like passwords or credit card numbers) through fake emails or websites.

Malware: Malicious software designed to disrupt or damage computer systems. This includes viruses, worms, and Trojans.

DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service): Flooding a server with so much traffic that it overwhelms the system and becomes unavailable to legitimate users.

SQL Injection: Exploiting a vulnerability in a web application's database to access, modify, or delete data.

Brute Force: Trying to guess a password or key by attempting a massive number of possible combinations.

Ransomware: A type of malware that locks down a user's files and demands a ransom payment to unlock them.

Attack Vectors

These are the methods or paths that attackers use to gain access to a system or network.

Social Engineering: Manipulating people to get them to give up confidential information. This often involves psychological tricks rather than technical hacking.

Wireless Attacks: Exploiting vulnerabilities in a Wi-Fi network to gain unauthorized access. This can include cracking the password or setting up a fake Wi-Fi access point.

Insider Threats: When an authorized person, like an employee or former employee, uses their access to steal data or damage a system.
